# TSE
The application does not need to be trained as all the data is stored within the tfmodel folder.

You may train the network again if you wish :)

**NOTE**
You must have Python 3.10 and the tensorflow and sklearn libraries installed for the application to function

If you encounter any issues then please report them on the issues page here: https://github.com/Group-14-TSE/TSE/issues
